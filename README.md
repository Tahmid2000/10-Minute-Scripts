# 10 Minute Scripts
Some short scripts I wrote to make my life easier. Feel free to use and optimize them for your needs!

## Automated File Transfer (utd_files.py)
<strong>Use:</strong> I personally use this for my UTD class files. 
I have my UTD directory set up with leaf directories of each of the courses I'm currently taking. 
Previously, whenever I downloaded a file for a specfic class,
I would have to name it with that course's 4 digit ID and then isnert it into the designated folder.
With this script, all I have to do is rename the file with the 4 digit ID and the file automatically
moves into the designated folder. Using cron jobs, I have this script running once a minute to check
if there are any files that need transferring. <br><br>
